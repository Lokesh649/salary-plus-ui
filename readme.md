📐 Design

The architecture is built on a modern tech stack leveraging Google Shell services:

Frontend:
React for a lightweight and responsive user interface, deployed on Firebase Hosting.
Backend:
Spring Boot REST APIs deployed on Cloud Shell.
Handles business logic, such as salary trend analysis and career recommendations.
Database:
Cloud SQL (MySQL) stores salary datasets, user preferences, and recommendations.
AI Integration:
Gemini API analyzes datasets to identify job trends and predict growth areas.
Deployment:
Google Cloud Platform ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless integration.
🛠️ Prerequisites

Google Cloud Setup:
Active GCP account
Enable services: Cloud SQL, Firebase Hosting, and Gemini API.
Tools Required:
Backend: Spring Boot (Java 17+), Maven
Frontend: React
Database: Cloud SQL (MySQL)
AI Integration: Gemini API.
📋 Step-by-step Instructions

1. Set Up Cloud SQL Database

Create a MySQL instance in Cloud SQL.
Import the IT Salary Dataset (downloaded from Kaggle) into the database.
sql:

CREATE TABLE salaries (

id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

job_title VARCHAR(100),

experience_level VARCHAR(50),

average_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),

location VARCHAR(100),

skills_required TEXT

);

2. Backend Implementation with Spring Boot

Develop REST APIs for:
Salary Trend Analysis: Returns salary trends by job title and location.
Career Recommendations: Recommends roles and skills based on user inputs.
Use the Gemini API for AI analysis:
java:

String prompt = “Analyze the following IT job data and predict the top roles for 2024…”;

String aiResponse = geminiApiClient.analyzeData(dataset, prompt);

Deploy the backend on Cloud Run.
3. Frontend Development with React

Use React to create:
A dashboard to display salary trends in charts (e.g., bar charts for job titles).
A form to capture user preferences (e.g., desired location, skills).
Deploy the React app to Firebase Hosting:
bash ~

firebase deploy

4. Integrate AI Features

Use to call Gemini APIs and display personalized insights:
javascript:

const fetchRecommendations = async (userInput) => {

const response = await fetch(“/api/recommendations”, {

method: “POST”,

body: JSON.stringify(userInput),

});

return response.json();

};

5. Deployment and Testing

Test the application locally and deploy the entire system using Google Cloud Shell services.
